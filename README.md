# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
Our purpose is to first identify all the retiring employees (based on birth date) who are still employeed at Pewlett Hackard, with the idea that these employees will have to be replaced in the near future.
Additionally, we created a list of employees (on birthdate, 1965) who would be strong candidates for the next mentorship program

## Results
*We have ~1.5k employees who are ready for the mentorship program
*About ~90k employees are about to retire with only 2 being managers
*Vast majority of retirements will be engineers and staff, a lot of lower/middle employees to replace
*While we do not have the numbers to replace the retiree estimate, we do have the right type of positions

#Summary: Unfortuantely, our retirement numbers vastly outnumber our mentorship program employees. We are looking at about ~90k retirees for approximately 1.5k mentorship employees.
We currently do not have the numbers to match the upcoming retirements, but they are in the proper positions. We will have to look for inside promotions or outside talent to help replace the upcoming retirements.
